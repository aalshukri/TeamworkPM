# TeamworkPM

This repository can be used to create summary statisitcs for projects on [TeamworkPM](https://www.teamwork.com/?partner=wd7z88gg5r) which can be used as the basis for monthly reports intended to help:

 - understand what project we have worked on
 - the ratio of time spent on projects and type of tasks within project
	ie, bugs, new, meetings, etc
 - reflect on what went well, what not went well
 - highlight improvements
